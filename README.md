## Process

### UI/UX Design

#### 1. UX Research
Our design process begins with extensive UX research to understand the needs, behaviors, and pain points of both students and teachers at Université de Béjaïa. This includes:
- **Surveys and Interviews:** Conducting surveys and interviews to gather insights directly from the users.
- **User Personas:** Creating detailed personas to represent different user types.
- **Journey Mapping:** Mapping out the user journey to identify key touchpoints and areas for improvement.

#### 2. Wireframing
Based on our research, we create wireframes to outline the basic structure and flow of the platform. These wireframes serve as a blueprint for the user interface.

#### 3. Prototyping
Next, we develop interactive prototypes that allow us to test and refine the user experience before moving into full development. This step ensures that our design solutions are both functional and intuitive.

#### 4. Visual Design
With feedback from the prototype, we finalize the visual design, focusing on creating an interface that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also aligned with our users' needs. We prioritize simplicity, clarity, and accessibility in all design decisions.

#### 5. User Testing
Before launching any feature, we conduct user testing sessions to validate our designs. This helps us identify any issues and make necessary adjustments to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Development Process

#### 1. Frontend Development
Using React.js/React Native, we build responsive and interactive user interfaces that work seamlessly across all devices.

#### 2. Backend Development
Our backend is currently in the planning stages. We don't have any backend developers at the moment, and we're seeking contributors to help us implement the backend. Please [Join Us](#join-us) if you're interested!

#### 3. Continuous Integration and Deployment
We plan to implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment, ensuring that our platform is always up-to-date and reliable.

#### 4. Quality Assurance
Throughout the development process, our QA team conducts thorough testing to ensure that the platform is free of bugs and performs optimally.
